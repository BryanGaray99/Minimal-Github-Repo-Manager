## Building and Running

1. Open the project in Android Studio.

2. Build and run the app on your emulator or physical device.

3. Explore and manage your GitHub repositories using the app.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have internet connectivity for the app to communicate with the GitHub API.

- Be cautious with your GitHub token, and do not expose it publicly.

- If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BryanGaray99/BryanGaray99-BryanGaray99-Minimal-Github-Repo-Manager.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd github-client-app
    ```

3. Create a new file named `env` in the `src/main/assets/` directory. This file should contain your GitHub username and token. Example:

    ```
    GITHUB_USER="your-username"
    GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
    ```

   Make sure to replace "your-username" and "your-github-token" with your GitHub username and token.

4. (Optional) Create an example `envExample` file for others to reference:

    ```bash
    cp src/main/assets/env src/main/assets/envExample
    ```

   This step is optional but can be useful for other developers to know the expected format of the `env` file.
